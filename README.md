# 2nd  Project SIO 2021/2022 - **Authentication**



## Description

For this assignment we decided to focus on the website we worked on for the first project and improve the security components implementing a new authentication protocol and exploring it. For this we created a new component that is responsible for authenticating the user login information and redirecting the user to the web-server if all is right, where as in the last project this was all done by the web-server component.



#### **How to execute:**

- Inside ***uap/src*** run 

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 uap.py
    ```

​		This will run the authentication server.



- Inside ***app_auth/flask***

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    python3 server.py
    ```

​		This will run the website.
